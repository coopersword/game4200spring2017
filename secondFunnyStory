My 18th birthday is the first and only birthday in which I didn't see any of my family. It was also my birthday during my freshman year here at Becker. At the  time, I had two roommates. One named Ian, the other named Manny. On this day,   Manny had gone to see his parents, and Ian and I never really got along. It was always a tradition to have a cake on a birthday, and to share it with friends, however. I didn't have many friends other than Manny, but the rest of the dorm was friendly enough. So, I went and bought a cake and invited everyone to have some, even Ian. Right before we could dig into the cake, however, Ian tried to knock the cake off of the table. Jon, one of the friendlier students at the dorm, however was fast enough to keep the cake from going splat on the floor. Ian then tried to kick the cake, but wound up just kicking the table with his shin. While he was on the ground crying about his shin, the rest of us simply enjoyed the cake.
